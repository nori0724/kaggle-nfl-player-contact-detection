- The solution was inspired by [DFL 1st's](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/discussion/359932) idea.
- Input consists of 15 frames in grayscale.
- Cropped around the helmet for input.   
- Crop size is 6 times the size of the helmet.
- Stacked in the channel direction with T=3 and input to a CNN.
- Then, stacked 5 feature maps in the time direction and aggregated the temporal features with a 3D CNN.

Final solution is as follows:
- First, compute the oof prediction using the 1st xgb model. The xgb features are arithmetic features related to the five players closest to the target player.  
- Extract players with xgb oof greater than 0.01. This reduces the data volume by 1/3.
- Created multiple CNN models such as p2g model, p2p model, p2p&p2p, and p2p RGB model.
- Use the CNN oof prediction as a feature and train a 2nd stage xgb model to obtain the final result.
